This program automatically generates ASP web sites. Full data base support (ADO 2.5) and integrated help file, and a ton of features. This is a professionally written ASP generator that I plan on putting on my Freeware web site. I have seen a few other examples of this sort of thing on PSC, so I thought I would just kill some time and make my own as I have a big ASP web site project coming up in a few days - needless to say this will shave a whole lot of time off of making the database interfaces. If you find this at all useful then please vote.
